I am currently a Founding Member of Technical Staff at a startup: [Player2](https://player2.game/). I focused on developing real-time action agent that can interact with commercial game environment and play with human. Please checkout the game-play videos from our model [here](https://elefant-ai.github.io/open-p2p/). We released the research details in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04575) and also release all the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/elefantai/p2p-full-data). Prior to Player2, I worked at Amazon AGI team as an Applied Scientist, focused on the pretraining and SFT of LLM. Before joining Amazon, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at the [Cortex Applied Research](https://cortex.twitter.com/) team at Twitter, with a focus on recommender system and reinforcement learning. I obtained my PhD from [Statistics and Data Science Department](https://https://stat.utexas.edu/) in [University of Texas at Austin](https://https://www.utexas.edu/), supervised by [Dr.Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Myresearch interest are **vision-language-action model**, **reinforcement learning** and **Multimodal LLM**.
